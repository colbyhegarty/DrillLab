Once the ball reaches an outside player, the game becomes a 5v3 rondo with four outside players and one inside player keeping possession\n5. The team of three now defends and tries to win the ball back\n6. As the single player passes to the outside, they switch roles with one of the three defenders who becomes the new single attacker\n7. The four outside players stay outside and work the ball around the perimeter while using the inside player\n8.

    "setup_text": "\u2022 Set up a 20x25 yard grid using cones\n\u2022 Place two small goals on one end of the grid for the defending team to attack\n\u2022 Divide your squad into a team of 11 and a team of 5, each wearing different colored jerseys\n\u2022 Position the team of 11 in their actual game formation inside the grid\n\u2022 Place the five defenders anywhere inside the grid to start\n\u2022 Have plenty of balls ready near the coach to restart play quickly",
    "instructions_text": "1. The team of 11 starts with possession and works to keep the ball while staying in their assigned positions\n2. Each player must remain in their positional area throughout the drill\n3. Players pass and move within their zone to create angles and maintain possession\n4. The five defenders press and work together to win the ball\n5. Award the team of 11 one point after they complete a set number of consecutive passes\n6. If the defending team wins possession, they immediately attack the two small goals\n7. The team of 11 transitions to defense and tries to stop the counterattack\n8. After a goal or the ball goes out, restart with the team of 11 in possession\n9. Rotate defenders every few minutes so different players experience the high intensity defensive work\n10. Keep the tempo high and competitive throughout",

    "coaching_points_text": "\u2022 Players must understand their position's responsibilities and stay disciplined in their area\n\u2022 Spacing is critical - players too close together makes defending easier\n\u2022 The ball should move faster than the defenders can press\n\u2022 Players need to check their shoulders constantly to know where pressure is coming from\n\u2022 Support angles should form triangles so the player with the ball always has two passing options\n\u2022 First touch should be clean and move the ball into space, not back toward pressure\n\u2022 Defenders must communicate and work as a unit to cut off passing lanes\n\u2022 When the ball switches sides, players on the far side need to adjust their position\n\u2022 The team of 11 should stay composed when pressed - no panic passes\n\u2022 After losing the ball, the nearest players must pressure immediately to slow the counterattack\n\u2022 Look for players scanning before receiving - this habit needs to become automatic",
