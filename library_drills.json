    "instructions_text": "1. One player from each line steps forward as the coach prepares to serve\n2. The coach plays a ball toward the opposite corner of the grid\n3. Both players race to get to the ball first\n4. The player who arrives first must position their body between the opponent and the ball\n5. Shield the ball using your body, arms out for balance, and feel where the defender is\n6. Read the pressure from the defender behind you\n7. If the defender is tight on your back, use a turn or spin move to escape the pressure\n8. If the defender gives you space, recognize it quickly and turn to face them\n9. After escaping pressure, attack one of the two small goals and try to score\n10. When the ball goes out, or a goal is scored, both players return to their lines\n11. The next two players immediately step out for the next repetition",
    "variations_text": "• Designate one line as attackers and one as defenders, giving attackers a two yard head start\n• Require players to dribble through a gate instead of shooting to work on close control\n• Add a touch limit where players must shoot within three touches after winning the ball\n• Make players use their weak foot only for the finish\n• Require a specific turn like a Cruyff turn or inside hook before they can score\n• Award bonus points for scoring on the far goal to encourage turning away from pressure\n• Add a time limit where players must score within five seconds of the coach's pass\n• Let the winner stay on and face the next challenger in a king of the grid format\n• Serve different types of balls, like bouncing, rolling, or in the air, to add variety\n• Increase grid size to 12x12 or 15x15 to give more space for developing players",
    "coaching_points_text": "• The first player to the ball must get their body between the opponent and the ball immediately\n• Arms should be out for balance and to feel contact with the opponent\n• Head should be up with quick glances to locate the defender and scan for the goals\n• First touch should be away from pressure if possible, not stopping the ball dead\n• Players need to feel the pressure through contact to know if the defender is tight or loose\n• When turning, use the inside or outside of the foot and keep the ball close during the movement\n• If the defender isn't applying pressure, take advantage immediately and face up\n• Low center of gravity with bent knees makes shielding stronger and more stable\n• After the turn, accelerate quickly into space before the defender can recover\n• The player without the ball should apply immediate pressure and try to stay goal-side\n• Watch for players just kicking the ball away under pressure instead of controlling it first",

    "instructions_text": "1. Start play with a 5v3 rondo in the first grid where five attackers work to maintain possession\n2. The three defenders press and try to win the ball\n3. When the three defenders win possession, they immediately switch play by passing to their two teammates waiting in the other grid\n4. As the ball travels to the second grid, three players from the original attacking team sprint to the second grid to defend\n5. The two players who were waiting now have three teammates join them to create a new 5v3 situation\n6. The two remaining players from the original attacking team stay in the first grid and wait\n7. Play continues with possession switching between grids each time the defending team wins the ball\n8. Rotate which three players transition to the other grid so everyone experiences different roles\n9. Keep the pace high and competitive throughout the drill",
    "variations_text": "• Increase grid size to 15x15 yards to make possession easier for developing players\n• Shrink grids to 10x10 yards to increase difficulty and speed up decision making\n• Limit all players to two touches to force quicker passing\n• Require one-touch passing only for an advanced challenge\n• Award points for completing a set number of passes before switching grids\n• Add a rule where the switch pass must be played in the air\n• Create a time challenge where teams see how many successful switches they can complete in two minutes\n• Require a specific player type to make the switch pass, like only the player who won the ball\n• Add small goals in each grid that the defending team can score on after winning possession\n• Make four players transition instead of three to increase the defensive challenge\n• Place a neutral player between the grids who must touch every switch pass",
    "coaching_points_text": "• The switch pass must be accurate and weighted properly to reach teammates in the other grid\n• Three players need to decide quickly who transitions to defend in the other grid\n• Players waiting in the empty grid should position themselves to receive the switch pass at good angles\n• Attackers in possession need constant movement to create passing options in tight space\n• First touch is critical in the small grid to keep the ball away from defenders\n• Defenders should press together and cut off passing lanes rather than chasing individually\n• Communication is huge during transitions so players know who's going and who's staying\n• Players transitioning to defend must sprint to apply pressure immediately in the new grid\n• The two waiting players should scan and anticipate when the switch might happen\n• Body shape when receiving matters to see multiple passing options and avoid pressure\n• Players staying behind should be ready in case the switch pass gets intercepted",

    "instructions_text": "1. The attacking team begins play by passing and moving to keep possession away from the single defender\n2. Attackers try to complete as many consecutive passes as possible\n3. Add a new defender when the attackers reach a set number of passes, such as 5 or 10 consecutive completions\n4. When possession changes, the attacking team starts their pass count from zero\n5. Continue adding defenders each time the pass target is reached\n6. The drill progresses from 6v1 to 6v2, then 6v3, and continues until a set time limit or number of defenders is reached\n7. Reset the drill or rotate players after reaching the predetermined endpoint",
    "variations_text": "• Limit attackers to two touches or one touch only to increase speed and sharpness\n• Award points to defenders if they force the ball out of bounds to increase their motivation\n• Require attackers to complete a minimum number of passes before they can score through a mini-goal\n• Create zones where the ball must enter before a pass counts toward the total\n• Add a rule where attackers must use both feet or alternate which foot they use\n• Place restrictions on where defenders can position themselves initially to give attackers time to settle\n• Make defenders do a physical challenge like five pushups before entering the grid\n• Track which group of attackers can complete the most passes before losing possession",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Attackers need to scan constantly to find open teammates and identify where space exists\n• Communication is essential as pressure builds. Simple calls help teammates know support is available\n• First touch must move the ball away from pressure and into space where the next pass opens up\n• Players without the ball should make sharp runs at angles to create clear passing lanes\n• As more defenders enter, attackers must spread wider to stretch the defense\n• The closest defender to the ball should apply immediate pressure to limit time and space\n• Defenders must stay patient and avoid diving in, which creates gaps for attackers to exploit\n• Defensive players should work together to cut off passing options and force mistakes\n• Watch for the transition moment when the ball turns over. Instant pressure or instant support makes the difference\n• Players switching from attack to defense need to recover quickly with their head up looking for the ball",

Players pass and move constantly to create passing angles\n4. The defender pressures the ball and works to win possession or force the ball out of bounds\n5. If the defender wins the ball, the player who lost it becomes the new defender\n6. If an attacker passes the ball out of bounds, that player becomes the defender\n7. Play continues with the new defender immediately pressing\n8. Keep the tempo high with quick restarts after each turnover\n9. Rotate through multiple rounds so everyone experiences defending",

    "coaching_points_text": "• Attackers should form a triangle shape around the defender to create the best passing angles\n• Movement without the ball is just as important as the pass itself\n• Players need to open their body when receiving so they can see both the ball and their next passing option\n• Use the back foot to receive passes when possible because it opens up more of the field\n• Look at one teammate but pass to another to deceive the defender\n• Passes should be firm and accurate to feet, not soft or behind the receiver\n• The first touch should set up the second touch, not just stop the ball\n• Players should constantly adjust their distance from each other based on where the defender is\n• Quick feet and body feints help sell a fake pass or movement\n• The defender should pressure intelligently and try to force passes into predictable areas\n• Communication helps but keep it simple and quick",

    "instructions_text": "1. The team of 11 starts with possession and works to keep the ball while staying in their assigned positions\n2. Each player must remain in their positional area throughout the drill\n3. Players pass and move within their zone to create angles and maintain possession\n4. The five defenders press and work together to win the ball\n5. Award the team of 11 one point after they complete a set number of consecutive passes\n6. If the defending team wins possession, they immediately attack the two small goals\n7. The team of 11 transitions to defense and tries to stop the counterattack\n8. After a goal or the ball goes out, restart with the team of 11 in possession\n9. Rotate defenders every few minutes so different players experience the high intensity defensive work\n10. Keep the tempo high and competitive throughout",
    "variations_text": "• Shrink the grid to 15x20 yards for advanced teams to increase pressure\n• Expand to 25x30 yards for younger or less experienced players\n• Limit the team of 11 to two touches to speed up decision making\n• Add a sixth or seventh defender to increase difficulty\n• Require the ball to go through specific positions before a point counts\n• Award bonus points for completing passes through certain zones like the middle third\n• Make the team of 11 complete a set passing pattern before earning points\n• Allow defenders to score double points on goals to increase their motivation\n• Create zones where only certain positions can receive the ball\n• Time each possession phase and track how long the team of 11 can keep the ball\n• Switch to one-touch passing in certain areas of the grid",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Players must understand their position's responsibilities and stay disciplined in their area\n• Spacing is critical - players too close together makes defending easier\n• The ball should move faster than the defenders can press\n• Players need to check their shoulders constantly to know where pressure is coming from\n• Support angles should form triangles so the player with the ball always has two passing options\n• First touch should be clean and move the ball into space, not back toward pressure\n• Defenders must communicate and work as a unit to cut off passing lanes\n• When the ball switches sides, players on the far side need to adjust their position\n• The team of 11 should stay composed when pressed - no panic passes\n• After losing the ball, the nearest players must pressure immediately to slow the counterattack\n• Look for players scanning before receiving - this habit needs to become automatic",

The three attackers pass and move to maintain possession while the lone defender pressures\n3. When the single defender wins the ball, they immediately pass to any outside player\n4. Once the ball reaches an outside player, the game becomes a 5v3 rondo with four outside players and one inside player keeping possession\n5. The team of three now defends and tries to win the ball back\n6. As the single player passes to the outside, they switch roles with one of the three defenders who becomes the new single attacker\n7. The four outside players stay outside and work the ball around the perimeter while using the inside player\n8. If the team of three wins possession back, play immediately switches to a 3v1 rondo again inside the grid\n9. Continue this back and forth pattern as possession changes hands\n10. Keep score by awarding points for completing a set number of consecutive passes",
    "variations_text": "• Shrink the grid to 15x15 yards for advanced players to increase pressure and speed\n• Expand the grid to 25x25 yards for beginners who need more time and space\n• Limit all players to two touches to speed up play\n• Require one-touch passing for outside players only\n• Award bonus points for switching the ball from one side of the grid to the other\n• For teams of 14, play 7v7 with four outside, three inside as defenders, and seven inside attacking\n• Add a rule where the ball must go through the middle player before counting toward the pass total\n• Create a time limit where teams see how many passes they can complete in 90 seconds\n• Make outside players move along their side rather than staying in corners\n• Remove the switching rule and keep the same single player for 60 seconds before rotating",
    "coaching_points_text": "• The transition moment is critical - players must switch their mindset from attack to defense instantly\n• Inside attackers should constantly move to create passing angles and triangles of support\n• The single defender needs to be smart about pressure - cut off one passing lane to force a predictable pass\n• Outside players must stay alert and ready to receive even though they're not currently in the action\n• Body shape matters when receiving - open up to see multiple passing options\n• Quick one or two touch passing keeps the ball moving and makes defending harder\n• Defenders should work together to press and cover passing lanes as a unit\n• Communication is huge - call for the ball and let teammates know when pressure is coming\n• Players switching roles need to move quickly into their new position\n• The pace should stay high - this isn't a walking drill",

    "setup_text": "• Create a 12x20 yard grid using cones\n• Mark two endzones that are 3x12 yards on each end of the grid\n• Divide your team into two groups of six players each, plus select two neutral players\n• Place four players from each team in the central playing area\n• Position one player from each team in each endzone\n• Station the two neutral players outside the long sides of the grid\n• Keep a supply of balls near the coach to restart play quickly",
    "instructions_text": "1. Start the game with one team in possession in the center grid\n2. The team with the ball plays 4v4 in the middle, using the two neutral outside players as passing options\n3. Players can pass to their teammate in the endzone to help maintain possession\n4. The endzone player must move to find open space and good angles to receive\n5. When an endzone player receives the ball, they can dribble out of the zone to join the game\n6. If the endzone player dribbles out, they switch positions with the player who passed them the ball\n7. Exception: if a neutral player passes to the endzone, no position switch happens and the ball must be passed back out\n8. When the other team wins the ball, they immediately try to keep possession and use their endzone player\n9. Start as a simple rondo with no scoring to let players learn the pattern\n10. Progress to scoring one point for completing a set number of consecutive passes\n11. Next progression: score one point for passing to the endzone and keeping possession\n12. Final progression: score one point for passing to one endzone, keeping the ball, then passing to the opposite endzone",
    "variations_text": "• Limit touches in the middle to two or one touch to increase the speed of play\n• Remove the neutral players to make it a true 4v4 and increase defensive pressure\n• Add a rule that the endzone player must receive the ball before the team can score\n• Make it directional where teams can only score in one specific endzone\n• Require the ball to touch the endzone player twice before a point counts\n• Change the number of passes needed for a point based on your team's skill level\n• Allow the defending team to send one player into the endzone to pressure\n• Give bonus points for one-touch passes to or from the endzone player\n• Shrink the grid size to increase pressure and speed up decision-making",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Players need to scan before receiving the ball to know where pressure is coming from and where space exists\n• First touch should move the ball into space away from defenders, not just stop it\n• The endzone player can't stand still - they must move side to side to create passing angles\n• Players in the middle should constantly check their shoulders to stay aware of all options\n• Speed of play matters - one or two touch passing breaks down the defense faster than holding the ball\n• Body shape when receiving is key - open up to see the whole field\n• Players off the ball need to move into passing lanes and create triangles of support\n• Communication helps - call for the ball when you're open but keep it simple and clear\n• When defending, work together to press as a unit and cut off passing lanes\n• The neutral players should move up and down their line to stay available at the right angle",

    "instructions_text": "1. Player 1 at the cone passes to Player 2 standing near the center mannequin\n2. Player 2 plays a quick one-touch return pass back to Player 1\n3. As soon as Player 2 makes the return pass, they sprint around the outside of the left mannequin\n4. Player 1 plays a breaking ball between the left and center mannequins into the space where Player 2 is running\n5. Player 2 receives the ball on their run and passes it across to the player at the opposite cone\n6. Players rotate positions: Player 1 moves to the center, Player 2 goes to the back of the opposite cone line\n7. Run both sides at the same time, with all runs going to the left side initially\n8. After several repetitions, switch the pattern so runs go around the right mannequin instead\n9. If players struggle with both sides going simultaneously, run one side at a time until they understand the pattern",
    "variations_text": "• Add a passive defender between the mannequins to make Player 1 disguise the breaking ball\n• Require Player 2 to finish on a small goal after receiving the breaking ball\n• Make the final pass to the opposite cone a specific type - driven, chipped, or outside of the foot\n• Have Player 2 make a fake run to one side before cutting around the other mannequin\n• Increase the distance between mannequins as players improve to work on longer breaking balls\n• Add a time limit - see how many successful combinations each group can complete in 60 seconds\n• Require two touches max for Player 2 when they receive the breaking ball before passing to the opposite cone",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Watch the timing of the run - Player 2 should start moving the moment they return the pass, not before\n• The breaking ball needs the right weight - not too hard, not too soft - so Player 2 can collect it in stride\n• Player 1 should aim the pass into the space between mannequins, not directly at Player 2\n• Player 2 needs to accelerate into the space, not jog - game speed runs create game speed habits\n• Check that Player 2 opens their body to receive the ball on the correct foot based on which direction they're running\n• Make sure players communicate - a simple call for the ball helps timing\n• The first pass in the 1-2 should be firm and accurate to the feet\n• Player 2's return pass should be one-touch when possible to speed up the combination",

Immediately after the pass, the passer becomes the defender and applies pressure.\n3. The receiving player must attempt to dribble through one of the three gates to escape the corner.\n4. A point is scored only if the ball is dribbled through a gate (no points for passing through).\n5. The receiver must read the pressure and decide whether to take a close control touch or a larger touch to escape around the defender.\n6. Rotate roles so all players have a chance to attack and defend.",
    "variations_text": "• Touch Limit: Allow only two touches to escape for added challenge.\n• Defender Delay: Defender must count to 1 before applying pressure to simulate real timing.\n• Smaller Gates: Narrow the gates to demand more precise control and execution.\n• Left/Right Only Rounds: Restrict dribbling escape to specific gates to work on directional skills.\n• Add a Timer: Players must escape within 5 seconds to encourage quick decision-making.",
    "coaching_points_text": "• First Touch Awareness: Encourage players to take touches based on the pressure — small if unpressured, big if defender is tight.\n• Read the Defender: Attackers must scan quickly and choose the right gate to escape through.\n• Body Positioning: Receive the ball on the half-turn to see both the field and the defender.\n• Defensive Pressure: Defenders should close down quickly and angle their approach to limit escape options.\n• Acceleration: Once an escape route is chosen, explode into space with speed.",

Player 4 dribbles quickly back to cone #1 and passes to the next player in line.\n6. Players rotate positions in the following order: Player 1 moves to player 2's spot. Player 2 moves to the opposite corner they play into. For example, if player 2 plays into player 3, player 2 moves to player 4's spot and player 3 stays.\n7.

The receiving player then passes the ball back through the gate.\n3. Once a pair completes three successful passes, they move back to the 10-yard marker and repeat.\n4. If players complete three successful passes at 10 yards, they move to 15 yards for the final challenge.\n5. If a player misses two passes in a row, they must move forward one marker and complete three successful passes before advancing again.\n6. The first pair to complete the 5, 10, and 15-yard markers successfully wins the round.",
    "variations_text": "• Smaller Gate Challenge: Narrow the gate to increase difficulty.\n• Weaker Foot Challenge: Require all passes to be made with the weaker foot.\n• Timed Competition: Players must complete all distances within a set time.\n• Moving Targets: Instead of standing still, players must move laterally after each pass.\n• One-Touch Progression: Advanced players must use one-touch passing after 5-yard success.",

    "instructions_text": "1. The red team (attackers) always starts with the ball.\n2. One attacker and one defender enter the field for a 1v1.\n3. The attacker dribbles to try to knock over any of the opponent’s cones by passing or shooting the ball into it.\n4. The defender attempts to block, delay, and win the ball to prevent the attacker from scoring.\n5. If the attacker knocks over a cone with the ball, their team earns a point, and the cone remains down.\n6. If the cone is accidentally kicked over by a foot, no point is awarded, and the cone is stood back up.\n7. As the ball goes out of bounds, or a pass or shot misses the cone, the next attacker and defender immediately start a new 1v1 series.\n8. Once all cones on one endline are knocked over, the attacking team wins the match.\n9. After the match, switch roles, allowing the defending team to attack and vice versa.",
    "variations_text": "• Weak Foot Challenge: Require players to score only using their weaker foot.\n• Time Constraint: Players must attempt to score within 10 seconds to increase intensity.\n• Multiple Attackers: Play 2v2 for increased complexity and teamwork.\n• Defensive Point System: Award defenders a point if they prevent a goal for 10 seconds.",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Encourage Controlled Dribbling: Attackers should use small touches and quick changes of direction.\n• Use Body Positioning: Defenders should stay low, delay the attacker, and force them wide.\n• Accuracy in Finishing: Players should aim for cones rather than powerfully kicking the ball.\n• Defensive Discipline: Defenders should avoid diving in and instead time their tackles effectively.\n• Decision-Making: Attackers must recognize when to dribble, shield, or attempt to score.",

The player who concedes the goal is eliminated and leaves the game.\n4. A new defender from the eliminated player’s team immediately steps on, and play continues.\n5.

    "variations_text": "• Time Limit: Require attackers to score within 5-10 seconds to encourage urgency.\n• Weaker Foot Challenge: Players must finish with their weaker foot to improve balance and shooting ability.\n• Defensive Advantage: Give defenders a slight head start to increase difficulty for attackers.\n• Double Elimination: If a player scores two goals in a row, they can eliminate two opponents instead of one.\n• Team Rotation: If one team eliminates all opponents, mix up teams and restart to keep intensity high.",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Encourage Aggressive Attacking: Attackers should drive at defenders with pace and confidence.\n• Defensive Resilience: Defenders must stay disciplined and delay attackers rather than diving in.\n• Quick Transitions: Players should react instantly after scoring and be ready for the next play.\n• Finishing Under Pressure: Attackers must use precise shooting techniques to beat defenders and score.\n• Game Awareness: Players should anticipate when to attack space or shield the ball based on positioning.",

The defending team works to win possession and immediately transitions to attacking play, using the corner players for support.\n5. The game flows continuously, with quick ball movement and positional adjustments.\n6. Play in 3-5 minute rounds, then rotate roles.",

The blue team (4 players) applies defensive pressure inside the grid to win the ball.\n3.

The red team, having lost possession, immediately moves inside the grid to defend.\n5. The drill continues fluidly, with teams transitioning between possession and defense without stopping play.\n6. Play in 3-5 minute rounds, focusing on maintaining tempo and quick transitions.\n7. Rotate each team as the possession team.",

    "instructions_text": "1. The first attacker in line dribbles forward and quickly chooses which gate to attack.\n2. The first defender in line steps out and tries to stop the attacker from dribbling through either gate.\n3. Attackers use feints, changes of pace, and body movement to get past the defender.\n4. Attackers can change gates to attack the other gate if the defender has effectively defended a gate.\n5. If the attacker successfully dribbles through a gate, they earn 1 point.\n6. If the defender wins possession or forces the attacker away from the gates, they earn 1 point.\n7. Players rotate after each round, and the first team to 10 points wins that round.",
    "variations_text": "• Weak Foot Challenge: Attackers must use their weaker foot when dribbling.\n• Time Limit: Attackers must attempt to score within 5 seconds.\n• Bonus Points: Award an extra point for attackers who successfully use a skill move before scoring.\n• 2v1 Variation: Introduce a second attacker to create a passing option and force defenders to make split-second decisions.\n• This drill is excellent for sharpening individual skills and reaction speed while keeping players engaged in a competitive setting.",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Attackers should use explosive changes of direction and speed to throw off defenders.\n• Encourage creative dribbling moves, such as scissors, step-overs, or shoulder feints.\n• Defenders must stay low, react quickly, and use proper foot positioning to force the attacker away.\n• Emphasize quick transitions after each play to keep the intensity high.\n• Keep players engaged by reinforcing competition and rewarding effort.",

Each side should be around 5-7 yards long, depending on the skill level and number of players.\n• Divide players into two groups of 5 players each. Use pinnies to differentiate the teams.\n• Place three players from each team around the outside of the hexagon, alternating colors on each side of the hex. These players must stay on the hexagon's sides and are restricted to their side.\n• Two players from each team will play as a 2v2 inside the hexagon, with the three supporting players outside the hexagon. The players inside the hexagon are free to move about the inside of the hexagon.",
    "instructions_text": "1. The coach starts the game by passing a ball to one of the teams.\n2. The objective is for this team to keep possession by using their two teammates in the middle of the hexagon and their teammates positioned around it.\n3. The two defenders on the other team will attempt to win or intercept the ball.\n4. If the defenders win the ball, they quickly play it to their teammates to maintain possession.\n5. After a minute or two of high-intensity possession, rotate the inside players with the outside players.\n6. The drill should be fast-paced, with quick turnovers and transitions between attack and defense.",
    "variations_text": "• Limit touches to one-touch passing for more advanced players to speed up the game and improve ball control under pressure.\n• Add more inside players to increase the difficulty for the attackers.\n• Reduce the size of the hexagon to create tighter spaces, requiring quicker decision-making and sharper passes.\n• Introduce a scoring system in which attackers gain a point for every consecutive 5 passes completed without interception, increasing the drill's competitive edge.",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Attacking players should constantly move along their side of the hexagon to create better passing angles and to receive the ball.\n• Encourage quick passing and movement from the attackers to force the defenders to work hard and prevent them from winning the ball.\n• Focus on quick passing and encourage players to use the outside foot to make smoother passes along the hexagon.\n• Encourage head-up play to ensure players are always aware of the defenders' positions and the passing options available.\n• Teach players to move into space after passing the ball to open up better angles for receiving.\n• Defenders should work together to press the ball and anticipate passing lanes to intercept.",

    "instructions_text": "1. The teams start in the middle of the field, and the coach plays a ball to begin the game.\n2. The objective is to score in one of the opponent's two goals while defending both of your own.\n3. Players can score in either of the two goals they are attacking, which forces the defending team to be aware of multiple threats and cover both goals.\n4. The game focuses on quick transitions between defending and attacking, as the ball can switch directions rapidly.\n5. When a goal is scored, restart the game quickly by having the coach play in another ball.\n6. Rotate players frequently to keep everyone involved and ensure each player gets practice in attacking and defending situations.",
    "variations_text": "• Limit touches for attacking players (e.g., two-touch maximum) to force quicker decision-making and movement.\n• Add neutral players (jokers) to create a numbers-up situation, giving the attacking team an advantage.\n• Increase the number of players (e.g., 6v6 or 7v7) to work on positioning in larger spaces.\n• Change the goal sizes to increase or decrease the challenge for attacking and defending.",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Attacking players must decide quickly which goal to target based on the defensive setup.\n• Defending players must communicate and position themselves effectively to cover both goals and block passing lanes.\n• Encourage quick decision-making when attacking; players should assess which goal is more open and position themselves accordingly.\n• Focus on defensive positioning and communication. Players should work together to cover both goals and prevent the attackers from having easy options.\n• Teach players to transition quickly from defense to attack and vice versa.\n• Promote creativity in attack, encouraging players to try different ways to create space and open up a goal-scoring opportunity.",

Players can shift the ball to the adjacent grid at any point to the player at the end line, and the players along the outside must quickly shift to their grid to offer good supporting positions and angles.\n3. The defender also shits into the other grid playing a 3v1 rondo in this grid.\n4. Play continues until the defender wins the ball, or for some allotted time, such as 2 minutes, then rotate.",

Use cones to define the boundaries.\n• Place the Mini-Goals: Position two mini-goals on each end line of the field, centered along the width. Ensure there is enough space for the players to move around the goals.\n• Divide the Teams: Split the players into two teams of four. If there are extra players, rotate them regularly or set up a second game.\n• Explain the Rules: Brief the players on the basic rules—no goalkeepers, regular throw-ins, and the importance of teamwork, passing, and positioning.",
    "instructions_text": "1. Start the Game: Place the ball in the center of the field and have one team kick off. Encourage both teams to focus on quick passing, moving off the ball, and accurate shooting at the mini-goals.\n2. Manage the Game: Monitor the game, guiding positioning and movement. Encourage positive play and emphasize the objectives of quick decision-making and teamwork.\n3. Rotate Players (if needed): If you have more than eight players, rotate them in after a set time (e.g., every 5 minutes) to keep everyone engaged and active.",

In the first iteration, do not allow the shielding player to touch the ball and simply focus on using their body to keep the defender off the ball.\n3. The shielding player should quickly position their body between the ball and the defender in an attempt to keep the ball from the defender.\n4. If the shielding player is able to keep the defender from touching the ball for 5 seconds, they receive a point.\n5. If the defender knocks the ball away, they should play the ball back to the center player and return to their corner.\n6. The players return to their position, and the coach calls out another number.\n7. Let all of the players have a chance to be the shielding player.\n8.

Allow two-touches depending on the skill level of the target player.\n5.

If the attacker successfully passes to their teammate, the new attacker then takes on the same defender and attempts to beat the defender and get to the other side of the grid to the waiting attacker.\n3. If the defender wins the ball, they play a ball to either of their teammates along the side. The attacker losing the ball becomes defender.\n4. The play continues as attackers lose the ball they immediately become the defender.",

Remember fast, slow, get down low, and get your hands on the attacker.\n• Defenders remember ball or player, never both.",

The player that just shot will immediately transition to defense and attept to stop the new attacker.\n6. Once the new attacker shoots the next player in the other line then attacks and the play continues.\n7. Players must quickly transition to defense as soon as the shot is taken on goal.\n8.

    "instructions_text": "1. Play 4v4 with each team defending a Pugg goal and scoring on the opponents Pugg goal.\n2. Players are restricted to their third of the field and are encouraged to move up and down their third in order to support their teammates.\n3. When a team reaches 5 goals switch out players or teams.",
    "variations_text": "• Allow players to switch into other thirds of the pitch, but when this happens, they must switch with the player occupying the grid they are moving into.",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Vision - players should be able to look up and read the game with their eyes since their number is limited. Player's heads should be on a constant pivot.\n• Communication - make sure players are communicating both verbally and non-verbally.\n• Support - make sure players are using their third of the field to get into the right supporting angles. Create passing options that allow the receiving players the most time and space.\n• Appropriate use of 1st touch\n• Appropriate use of short or long passing\n• Changes in the direction and speed of play\n• Create goal scoring opportunities",

The attacker can fake and feint and go in either direction at any time during this drill.\n6.

The keeper then leaves the ball and shuffles through the next set of cones towards the ball.\n5. The keeper will repeat diving to each of the balls set up by the coach.\n6.

The attacker can fake and feint and go the other direction at any time.\n6. Once a goal is scored or the ball goes out of bounds, the two players must run around the cone closest to the goal they are attacking on their side of the field and sprint to the cone near the opposite goal.\n7.

The outside player immediately passes to a player adjacent to them on their right or left.\n3. Make sure the central player maintains his central positioning.\n4. As soon as the outside player passes to the player to the right or left, they immediately begin their run to overlap that player.\n5. The player being overlapped quickly returns the ball to the central player who plays into the space of the overlapping player.\n6. The overlapping player switches roles with the central player and the play continues.\n7. Leave it up to the players to decide whether to play to the left or right side of the outside player based on whether the player is being used by the other central player.\n8. Players must play with their heads up scanning the field and communicating so that two balls do not get played to the same player.",

A breakdown in passing will throw off a well-timed overlapping run.\n• Play in 1 touch.\n• Good crisp passes with good pace on them - not too soft or too strong.\n• Heads up scanning the field to find the open players\n• Play with speed. Start slow and once they figure it out, ramp it up.\n• Make sure central players maintain the central position until switching with the outside player in order to play facing the ball. If they get in too tight there will not be much time to play the ball.",

The outside player returns the pass back to the central player who maintains his central positioning.\n3. The central player then immediately plays to the player to the left or right of the initial player he passed to.\n4. As this second outside player receives the pass he now switches roles with the central player and looks to continue the same pattern on the opposite side of the grid.\n5. Leave it up to the players to decide whether to play to the left or right side of the outside player based on whether the player is being used by the other central player.\n6. Players must play with their heads up scanning the field and communicating so that two balls do not get played to the same player.",

If they get in too tight there will not be much time to play the ball.\n• Allow the kids to be creative with their combination play.",

The front player then sprints around the stick looking for a ball from the back checking player to shoot.\n5. The back checking player plays a 1st time ball into the middle of the sticks.\n6. The front checking player has a shot on goal.\n7. The shooting player rotates to the top line the back player goes back to the line and becomes the front player, the player from the top goes to the back of the line on the end line.\n8.

This is a large field for 2v2, but this is intentional as it will create more breakaway situations and will encourage players to attack the space while going to goal.\n• Place a small goal or Pugg goal on each end line.\n• Split the team into 2 equal groups, one with an alternate jersey color.\n• Assign each player a partner on his team. These players will continue to be teammates throughout the entire soccer drill.\n• Assign each team a goal to defend.\n• 2 players from each team step out to play 2v2. The remaining players should line up across their defensive end line with a large supply of balls.",
    "instructions_text": "1. Play 2v2 inside the grid to the small goals.\n2. If a team gets scored on they step off and two new team members step on with the ball. They look to get a quick attack on the team that just scored.\n3. As a team scores a goal, they must quickly transition to stop the quick attack.\n4. The scoring team stays on the field and plays 2v2 until they get scored on.\n5. If the ball goes out of bounds, the ball restarts from a teammate on their end line. Players only switch after their group gets scored on.\n6. First team to 20 wins.",

The size can vary depending on age and skill level of your team.\n• You will need 8 players per grid split equally into teams of 4 players.\n• 2 players from each team should align themselves diagonally across the field from each other at two of the corners (outside the grid).\n• The remaining players play 2v2 inside the grid.",

Once a pass is made to the outside player the players switch, so the outside players either dribble or pass to their teammate and play 2v2. The player passing to the outside player takes his spot and becomes the target player at his cone.\n3. The new attacker plays 2v2 to combine with their teammate at the other corner. If the corner is denied by the defending players, the team should play to their most open diagonal player to keep possession of the ball.\n4. If the defensive team wins the ball they become the attackers and attempt to keep possession as described above.",

Place a player on each of these cones.\n• Place another cone in the middle of the field about 10 yards from the side cones.\n• The shape of the cones should be in a diamond with the cone closest to the goal having a small window.\n• his window will be used as a passing reference for the player to receive the ball as they check into this space.\n• The remaining players should be positioned at the cone farthest from goal with a ball each.",

As Player 2 is making the pass to player 3, the new player 1 makes a pass to player 4 and follows his pass.\n6. Player 4 passes to the new player 3 who is checking-in between the cones.\n7.

See diagram for field layout.\n• Split the team into groups of 2, each partner group having the same jersey color.\n• One of the teammates starts in line 1 where the other player begins in line 2 in the same order, so they go simultaneously.\n• Begin with one set of partners as the defenders, each in one of the two 10X10 grids in front of the goal.",

The defenders try to deny the player from dribbling through the grid.\n5. If both of the defenders wins the ball, or the ball is knocked out the sides of the grid, do the attacking team become the defenders.\n6. If only one defender wins the ball and the other team makes it through the grid, the defenders stay and continue to defend the grid with the next group of partners.\n7.

In our soccer drill diagram, the blue player starts as the defender, and the red team is the attacking team.",

If the player successfully makes it through the grid and out the other side by dribbling, he then plays to the first player in the line he is facing.\n3. This next player again takes on the defender in the middle.\n4. If the defender wins the ball, or the ball is knocked out of the grid, the player losing the ball becomes the defender.\n5. The player who won the ball or forced the player out of bounds passes the ball to a teammate in line who now attacks the new defender in the middle in an attempt to get through to the other side and pass to the next player in line.\n6. This drill's pace must be very fast and encourage players to take advantage of an off-balanced defender.\n7. The defender will have to transition quickly to get out of the middle.",

The player with the ball needs at least two players giving him direct support and at least one player giving him indirect support by stretching the field and creating space.\n• Movement- Players should continuously make runs to create space and time when receiving passes.\n• Evade defenders- Make a quick change of direction, change of speed runs to escape defenders, and create space to receive a pass.",

    "instructions_text": "1. Play a 4v2 in the first grid with four red offensive players and two blue defensive players.\n2. The offensive players focus on early support, correct angles, good distance, and giving the player with the ball at least two passing options at all times.\n3. The defender's objective is to gain possession and pass to a teammate in the other grid.\n4. If one of the blue defenders gain possession of the ball, they pass to a blue teammate in the other grid.\n5. The two blue defenders then join his team in the other grid and assist in maintaining possession.\n6. Two players from the red team enter the grid as defenders.\n7. The red defending players now attempt to win possession and return the ball into the other grid with their teammates.\n8. Continue to play 4v2 by repeating this pattern.\n9. This game should be very dynamic, and players should be moving at all times.\n10. Even the players waiting in the opposite grid should be moving to put themselves in an excellent supporting role.",
    "variations_text": "• Limit the players number of touches",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Early support - start supporting before the ball is received.\n• Good angle - support in undefended space where the pass cannot be intercepted by the defender.\n• Players must move, even without the ball.\n• Supporting players should create a triangle to support both sides of the attacker with the ball.\n• Focus on a good first touch in space towards a supporting player.\n• Use deception when playing.",

The blue defender's objective is to gain possession of the ball.\n4. If the blue defender gains possession of the ball, they pass to a blue teammate in the other grid.\n5. The blue defender then joins his team in the grid to maintain possession.\n6. One player from the red team enters the new grid as a defender.\n7. The red defending player now tries to win possession and return the ball into the other grid with their teammates.\n8. The defenders rotate defenders with a new defender each time.",

Player 4 is looking to deny the cross.\n3. Player 2 also leaves to defend player 1 on the cross.\n4. Player 3 crosses the ball into player 1, who attempts to finish on goal.\n5. Rotate players so that they play both offense and defense on all of the spots.",

The defenders should focus on a fast, controlled approach while positioning their body between the ball and the middle of the goal.\n3. At this point, the defenders are not trying to win the ball but working on the speed of the approach, body posture, and positioning.\n4. Let every player go 4-5 times or until they are comfortable with approaching the attacker.",

    "instructions_text": "1. The one outside fullbacks and one winger are the only players that are allowed in the lane.\n2. The server plays the ball into one of the two outside wingers to begin the game.\n3. Instruct the outside fullback to let the winger turn and face him before applying pressure to the winger. If the winger is having problems beating the defender, have the defender play 50-75%.\n4. The winger will then play 1v1 against the outside back.\n5. The winger's job is to beat the fullback down the line.\n6. Only after the winger beats the defender can he pass into the 4v4 in the middle of the field. This service can come off of a pass, cross.\n7. Once receiving a pass from the winger, the offensive team attempts to score a goal.\n8. If the defensive team wins the ball, the play is reset and started over from the server at mid-field.",
    "variations_text": "• Only allow a cross from the winger after they beat the defender and focus on crossing and finishing.\n• Limit the defensive pressure on the outsides from 50%-75% to allow the winger to get down the line.",

Give the wingers ideas on their decisions, such as a pass, cross, shot, continue dribbling to the end line, etc.",

This will be the starting point of the outside crossing players.\n• About 12-15 yards from the penalty area create a grid that is about 15 yards wide and 10 yards deep.

Player 4 makes a run around the outside of the training stick towards the corner flag, has a prep touch, and serves the ball into the finishing forwards.

The two attackers join with the target player to form a 3v2 (2v2+1 target player) situation.\n3. The attackers attempt to score while the two defensive players work together to stop the attack.\n4. If the defenders win the ball, they should clear the ball past the line where the additional attackers are standing.\n5. If the defenders are successful at clearing the ball, the attacking players (minus the target player) should do ten pushups.\n6. If the defender attempts to clear the ball and cannot clear the ball far enough to cross the line, the attacking team continues their attack.\n7. Once the ball is out of play or deemed dead by the coach, the goalkeeper should punt a new ball to the next group of attackers, and two new defenders step in and become defenders.",

The players in the three finishing lines make curved runs and attack the near post, middle, and far post to finish on goal as quickly as possible.\n3. If the shooter is slow to shoot or receives the ball with their back facing the goal, they should play the ball to the centerline for a first-time shot on goal.",

    "instructions_text": "1. Players should pass to the next highest number upon receiving the ball. Player #1 passes to #2; #2 passes to #3; #3 passes to #4; finally #6 passes to #1 and the warm-up continues.\n2. Next, reverse the pattern where #6 plays to #5, #5 passes to #4; etc.\n3. Next, players play to odd players if they are odd numbers and even players play to even numbers. For Example, #1 passes to #3, #3 passes to #5, etc. and #2 passes to #4, #4 passes to #6, etc.\n4. Decrease the number of touches to make the speed of play faster by demanding quicker thought process.\n5. Limit the verbal communication by limiting the number of words the players can speak. For example, only let then say one word. So player #1 might ask for player #2 by saying \"TWO.\"\n6. Lastly, only allow non-verbal communication such as hand clapping, pointing, eye contact, etc.",

When any one of the attackers has the opportunity, they should dribble across the middle defensive grid (defended by the remaining two defenders) and make their way into the other attacking 3rd where they give that grid a numerical advantage.\n4. The two defenders that were formerly defending the middle third now step in and defend the 3rd attacking grid while the remaining two defenders now defend the middle grid.\n5. This will cause one grid always to play 5v2 while the other grid will always play 4v2.\n6. If the defender wins the ball they should play the ball back to the coach who quickly restarts the play.\n7. It is essential that the attacker DRIBBLES across the grid and into the other attacking 3rd.",

If the defender is successful, he hands the alternate jersey to the attacker, and they switch roles.\n5.

As the keeper back peddles towards the goal throw a high lofted ball at the goal where the goalkeeper must punch over the crossbar or catch it.\n4. After the ball is caught, the coach throws a ball towards the near post in which the keeper must quickly react and push the ball past the post out of touch or catch the ball.\n5. The coach then quickly throws another ball towards the far post and the keeper must again catch or push the ball past the post.\n6. After this ball is caught the coach then shoots the next ball on goal and the keeper must make a save again.\n7. Now move to the other side of the goal and do it again.\n8.

The outside team scores a point when their teammate passes the ball between two defenders (SPLIT), and their teammate cleanly receives the pass from across the grid.\n4. If a player on the attacking team makes a mistake, he and his partner become the defenders and the team winning the ball comes outside the cones and joins the other attackers.\n5.

So for example, if the two defenders get split two times before winning the ball, they must win the ball three times before switching with the attackers.",

    "instructions_text": "1. Each shooter begins at the start cone while their shagger starts behind the goal.\n2. At the first cone, each shooter will take turns shooting on goal in an attempt to score the goal with a direct shot into the goal without it hitting the ground (no bounce).\n3. If the ball bounces before scoring a goal, or if they miss the goal, the shooter retrieves the ball from their shagger and continue shooting from the same cone.\n4. If the player can strike the ball into the goal without it bouncing, the player will get to continue to the next cone.\n5. The first three players to successfully scored from each of the five cones win.\n6. Now switch and let the shaggers shoot and the shooters shag balls.\n7. The game will seem slow to start, but as the game gets going the players are working hard, and friendly competition should kick in and elevate the game.",
    "variations_text": "• For younger players who are unable to lift the ball very well should be modified to scoring hard shots with pace on the ball.\n• To get all the players participating at the same time, have each player start with their ball (no shaggers) and have them keep up with their same ball throughout the entire shooting game. Have half of the group start on the finish cone and work backward while the other group starts on the start cone.",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Watch the angle of approach, make sure they come at the ball at a good kicking angle\n• Make sure their planting foot is not too close or too far from the ball.\n• Make sure the player is locking their ankle",

Once the player makes it through the traffic jam, instruct them to dribble with speed to the line they are facing and pass the ball to the first player in line.\n3. That player should immediately head towards the traffic jam with speed in an attempt to get through the traffic jam first.\n4. At first, don’t keep score, merely let the players enjoy the close calls before playing the game.\n5. After 8-10 minutes, combine the two teams that are facing each other into one team.\n6. Next, have the players race through the traffic jam to the cone on the opposite side of the grid, around that cone and back through the traffic jam.\n7. As each player finishes the race, they must sit down to signify to the group that they have completed the race.\n8. The team that has all the players sitting down first wins the game.",

The player at position 1 can pass to either of the players at positions 2 and 4.\n4. If the player at position 1 passes to the player at position 2, the player at position 4 must quickly move to position 3 to support the player in “un-defended space.”\n5.

Players must switch with the teammate outside the 18 when the player is played through those players. For example, if the red team has possession, they must play the ball through an outside player before shooting on goal.\n4. Once the red player plays to the red player outside the 18, those two players switch roles, and red is now free to attack the goal.\n5. If blue wins possession, the ball must be played through a blue player on the outside who also switch roles and attack the goal.\n6. The game must be very dynamic, and players should be changing roles constantly.\n7. Encourage players to take shots and use players for quick combinations.",

The two original attackers that lost the ball must sprint back to their line freeing up 2 new defenders to step out and defend.\n5.

That player will then goes to the end of their team's line and await their turn again. Once the shooting player dribbles back into the 5X5 box, his team can send in another man to even up the match at 2v2. In the meantime, the other team sprints to the 5X5 box attempting to catch the team who just missed a shot in a man-down situation.\n6. If a team scores a goal, they receive a point, the defensive player closest to the ball must dig the ball out of the goal, and return the ball to the 5X5 box.

The two-touch limit does not apply to the defenders as they try and keep the ball away from the target.\n6. When the target player wins the ball back, he must play over to the waiting 3 players in the other half.\n7.

The attacking mid players look to penetrate and immediately by playing into an attacker in the attacking third.\n3. Restrict players to remain in their assigned third of the field except for the midfielder advancing the ball to the attacking third.\n4. The midfield player that passes to an attacker in the attacking third joins this area and play 3v2 (in the attacking third).\n5. If the defensive players win the ball, they should play keep-away from the attacking team.\n6. The coach should have an ample supply of balls and can restart the series at any time.",

Create multiple fields if possible to include more players.\n• Create a gate (about 8 feet wide) on each end line.\n• Divide the group into two teams of four players each.\n• Since the field is longer than it is wide, the playing field's dimensions emphasize passing in the game. There is a premium on playing the ball forward early.",

    "variations_text": "• Alternatively, create an end line with cones for the players to attack. A goal is scored by stopping the ball anywhere along the endline.\n• Depending on the age and skill level of the players, you can adjust the field size to maximize the effectiveness of the workout.",
    "coaching_points_text": "• Vision - players should be able to look up and read the game with their eyes since their number is limited. Player's heads should be on a constant pivot.\n• Communication - make sure players are communicating both verbally and non-verbally.\n• Support - make sure players are using the entire playing area (width and length) to get into the right supporting angles. Create passing options that allow the receiving players the most time and space.\n• Appropriate use of 1st touch\n• Appropriate use of short or long passing\n• Changes in the direction and speed of play\n• Create goal scoring opportunities",

The two checking players should be about 5-7 yards apart from each other when checking.\n3. The top player plays the ball in towards the front checking player and sprints around the stick on the sidelines closest to him.\n4. The first checking player dummies the run by stepping over the ball and letting it run between their legs.\n5. The front player then sprints around the back stick and makes a run to the back post.\n6. The back checking player plays a 1st-time ball into the space of the outside stick for the top player to cross on one touch and sprints around the closest stick and makes the front post run.\n7. The outside player serves a first time ball into the box for the runners to finish on goal.\n8. The player that makes the back post run moves to the top line the back player goes back to the line and becomes the front player, the player from the top goes to the back of the line on the end line.\n9.

If they are too far inside, a good solid cross on the ground into the advancing player. If they are outside, drive a good cross into the advancing players.\n• Checking players should pay attention and focus on their runs.\n• Passes and shot should be 1 touch when possible.\n• Focus on good finishing and shooting technique and putting the ball on target.\n• Make sure runs are properly timed and the runners are not in the box too soon or too late.\n• Make sure the back post runner does not let the ball through.\n• Make sure the front post runner is cutting to the front post.",
