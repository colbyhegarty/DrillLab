Once the ball reaches an outside player, the game becomes a 5v3 rondo with four outside players and one inside player keeping possession\n5. The team of three now defends and tries to win the ball back\n6. As the single player passes to the outside, they switch roles with one of the three defenders who becomes the new single attacker\n7. The four outside players stay outside and work the ball around the perimeter while using the inside player\n8.

The five defenders press and work together to win the ball\n5. Award the team of 11 one point after they complete a set number of consecutive passes\n6. If the defending team wins possession, they immediately attack the two small goals\n7. The team of 11 transitions to defense and tries to stop the counterattack\n8.
